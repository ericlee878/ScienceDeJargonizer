  Reject Option","Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a well-known Machine Learning (ML) model
for linear classification problems. It can be used in conjunction with a reject
option strategy to reject instances that are hard to correctly classify and
delegate them to a specialist. This further increases the confidence of the
model. Given this, obtaining an explanation of the cause of rejection is
important to not blindly trust the obtained results. While most of the related
work has developed means to give such explanations for machine learning models,
to the best of our knowledge none have done so for when reject option is
present. We propose a logic-based approach with formal guarantees on the
correctness and minimality of explanations for linear SVCs with reject option.
We evaluate our approach by comparing it to Anchors, which is a heuristic
algorithm for generating explanations. Obtained results show that our proposed
method gives shorter explanations with reduced time cost.","correctness,minimality,Anchors","16 pages, submitted to BRACIS 2023 (Brazilian Conference on

  Task-Solving Agent through Multi-Persona Self-Collaboration","Human intelligence thrives on cognitive synergy, where collaboration among
different minds yield superior outcomes compared to isolated individuals. In
this work, we propose Solo Performance Prompting (SPP), which transforms a
single LLM into a cognitive synergist by engaging in multi-turn
self-collaboration with multiple personas. A cognitive synergist is an
intelligent agent that collaboratively combines multiple minds' strengths and
knowledge to enhance problem-solving in complex tasks. By dynamically
identifying and simulating different personas based on task inputs, SPP
unleashes the potential of cognitive synergy in LLMs. Our in-depth analysis
shows that assigning multiple fine-grained personas in LLMs improves
problem-solving abilities compared to using a single or fixed number of
personas. We evaluate SPP on three challenging tasks: Trivia Creative Writing,
Codenames Collaborative, and Logic Grid Puzzle, encompassing both
knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive types. Unlike previous works, such
as Chain-of-Thought, that solely enhance the reasoning abilities in LLMs,
experimental results demonstrate that SPP effectively reduces factual
hallucination, and maintains strong reasoning capabilities. Additionally,
comparative experiments show that cognitive synergy only emerges in GPT-4 and
does not appear in less capable models, such as GPT-3.5-turbo and
Llama2-13b-chat, which draws an interesting analogy to human development. Code,

  Large Language Models","Modeling evolving knowledge over temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) has become
a heated topic. Various methods have been proposed to forecast links on TKGs.
Most of them are embedding-based, where hidden representations are learned to
represent knowledge graph (KG) entities and relations based on the observed
graph contexts. Although these methods show strong performance on traditional
TKG forecasting (TKGF) benchmarks, they face a strong challenge in modeling the
unseen zero-shot relations that have no prior graph context. In this paper, we
try to mitigate this problem as follows. We first input the text descriptions
of KG relations into large language models (LLMs) for generating relation
representations, and then introduce them into embedding-based TKGF methods.
LLM-empowered representations can capture the semantic information in the
relation descriptions. This makes the relations, whether seen or unseen, with
similar semantic meanings stay close in the embedding space, enabling TKGF
models to recognize zero-shot relations even without any observed graph
context. Experimental results show that our approach helps TKGF models to
achieve much better performance in forecasting the facts with previously unseen
relations, while still maintaining their ability in link forecasting regarding
seen relations.","temporal knowledge graphs,embedding-based TKGF methods,TKG forecasting",Accepted to NAACL 2024 main conference,2024-03-15 15:38:07+00:00,2023-11-15 21:25:15+00:00,"['Zifeng Ding', 'Heling Cai', 'Jingpei Wu', 'Yunpu Ma', 'Ruotong Liao', 'Bo Xiong', 'Volker Tresp']","['cs.AI', 'cs.CL', 'cs.LG']",cs.AI,,,TRUE
2310.08992v3,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08992v3,"CodeChain: Towards Modular Code Generation Through Chain of
  Self-revisions with Representative Sub-modules","Large Language Models (LLMs) have already become quite proficient at solving
simpler programming tasks like those in HumanEval or MBPP benchmarks. However,
solving more complex and competitive programming tasks is still quite
challenging for these models - possibly due to their tendency to generate
solutions as monolithic code blocks instead of decomposing them into logical
sub-tasks and sub-modules. On the other hand, experienced programmers
instinctively write modularized code with abstraction for solving complex
tasks, often reusing previously developed modules. To address this gap, we
propose CodeChain, a novel framework for inference that elicits modularized
code generation through a chain of self-revisions, each being guided by some
representative sub-modules generated in previous iterations. Concretely,
CodeChain first instructs the LLM to generate modularized codes through
chain-of-thought prompting. Then it applies a chain of self-revisions by
iterating the two steps: 1) extracting and clustering the generated sub-modules
and selecting the cluster representatives as the more generic and re-usable
implementations, and 2) augmenting the original chain-of-thought prompt with
these selected module-implementations and instructing the LLM to re-generate
new modularized solutions. We find that by naturally encouraging the LLM to
reuse the previously developed and verified sub-modules, CodeChain can
significantly boost both modularity as well as correctness of the generated
solutions, achieving relative pass@1 improvements of 35% on APPS and 76% on
CodeContests. It is shown to be effective on both OpenAI LLMs as well as
open-sourced LLMs like WizardCoder. We also conduct comprehensive ablation
studies with different methods of prompting, number of clusters, model sizes,
program qualities, etc., to provide useful insights that underpin CodeChain's
success.","pass@1,APPS,CodeContests",Accepted to ICLR 2024,2024-03-14 03:29:09+00:00,2023-10-13 10:17:48+00:00,"['Hung Le', 'Hailin Chen', 'Amrita Saha', 'Akash Gokul', 'Doyen Sahoo', 'Shafiq Joty']","['cs.AI', 'cs.CL', 'cs.PL']",cs.AI,,,TRUE

  Graph","Due to the ubiquity of graph data on the web, web graph mining has become a
hot research spot. Nonetheless, the prevalence of large-scale web graphs in
real applications poses significant challenges to storage, computational
capacity and graph model design. Despite numerous studies to enhance the
scalability of graph models, a noticeable gap remains between academic research
and practical web graph mining applications. One major cause is that in most
industrial scenarios, only a small part of nodes in a web graph are actually
required to be analyzed, where we term these nodes as target nodes, while
others as background nodes. In this paper, we argue that properly fetching and
condensing the background nodes from massive web graph data might be a more
economical shortcut to tackle the obstacles fundamentally. To this end, we make
the first attempt to study the problem of massive background nodes compression
for target nodes classification. Through extensive experiments, we reveal two
critical roles played by the background nodes in target node classification:
enhancing structural connectivity between target nodes, and feature correlation
with target nodes. Followingthis, we propose a novel Graph-Skeleton1 model,
which properly fetches the background nodes, and further condenses the semantic
and topological information of background nodes within similar
target-background local structures. Extensive experiments on various web graph
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.
In particular, for MAG240M dataset with 0.24 billion nodes, our generated
skeleton graph achieves highly comparable performance while only containing
1.8% nodes of the original graph.","background nodes,massive background nodes compression,structural connectivity,taget-background local structures","21 pages, 11 figures, In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2024

of the contribution of a node on a target node in a DAG. By recursively writing
each node as a function of the upstream noise terms, we separate the intrinsic

interpret the intrinsic information as a {\it causal} contribution, we consider
`structure-preserving interventions' that randomize each node in a way that
mimics the usual dependence on the parents and does not perturb the observed
joint distribution. To get a measure that is invariant with respect to
relabelling nodes we use Shapley based symmetrization and show that it reduces
in the linear case to simple ANOVA after resolving the target node into noise
variables. We describe our contribution analysis for variance and entropy, but
contributions for other target metrics can be defined analogously. The code is

Hence, in this paper, we aim to answer causal questions with a causality graph,
a large-scale dataset of causal relations between noun phrases along with the
relations' provenance data. Inspired by recent, successful applications of
reinforcement learning to knowledge graph tasks, such as link prediction and
fact-checking, we explore the application of reinforcement learning on a
causality graph for causal question answering. We introduce an
Actor-Critic-based agent which learns to search through the graph to answer
causal questions. We bootstrap the agent with a supervised learning procedure
to deal with large action spaces and sparse rewards. Our evaluation shows that
the agent successfully prunes the search space to answer binary causal
questions by visiting less than 30 nodes per question compared to over 3,000
nodes by a naive breadth-first search. Our ablation study indicates that our
supervised learning strategy provides a strong foundation upon which our
reinforcement learning agent improves. The paths returned by our agent explain
the mechanisms by which a cause produces an effect. Moreover, for each edge on

KGs capture not only factual information but also contextual knowledge. In some
tasks, a few KGs established themselves as standard benchmarks. However, recent
works outline that relying on a limited collection of datasets is not
sufficient to assess the generalization capability of an approach. In some
data-sensitive fields such as education or medicine, access to public datasets

we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the single-step predictor,
by using a tree-shaped MDP to optimize complete routes. Specifically, we
propose a novel online training algorithm, called Planning with Dual Value

extending the ST framework to address the risks of social misattributions in
Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in sensitive areas like mental

personas, may lead to mismatches between designers' intentions and users'
perceptions of social attributes, risking to promote emotional manipulation and
dangerous behaviors, cases of epistemic injustice, and unwarranted trust. To
address these issues, we propose enhancing the ST framework with a fifth
'W-question' to clarify the specific social attributions assigned to LLMs by
its designers and users. This addition aims to bridge the gap between LLM
capabilities and user perceptions, promoting the ethically responsible

  Task Allocation","Most real-world Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problems require fast and
efficient decision-making, which is often achieved using heuristics-aided
methods such as genetic algorithms, auction-based methods, and bipartite graph
matching methods. These methods often assume a form that lends better
explainability compared to an end-to-end (learnt) neural network based policy
for MRTA. However, deriving suitable heuristics can be tedious, risky and in
some cases impractical if problems are too complex. This raises the question:
can these heuristics be learned? To this end, this paper particularly develops
a Graph Reinforcement Learning (GRL) framework to learn the heuristics or
incentives for a bipartite graph matching approach to MRTA. Specifically a
Capsule Attention policy model is used to learn how to weight task/robot
pairings (edges) in the bipartite graph that connects the set of tasks to the
set of robots. The original capsule attention network architecture is
fundamentally modified by adding encoding of robots' state graph, and two
Multihead Attention based decoders whose output are used to construct a
LogNormal distribution matrix from which positive bigraph weights can be drawn.
The performance of this new bigraph matching approach augmented with a
GRL-derived incentive is found to be at par with the original bigraph matching
approach that used expert-specified heuristics, with the former offering
notable robustness benefits. During training, the learned incentive policy is
found to get initially closer to the expert-specified incentive and then
slightly deviate from its trend.","Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problems,Graph Reinforcement Learning (GRL) framework,bipartite graph matching approach,,Capsule Attention policy mode,robots' state graph,positive bigraph weights,learned incentive policy,expert-specified incentive","This paper was accepted for presentation in proceedings of IEEE

  to Assist Human Labelers' Preference Elicitation","Preference-based learning aims to align robot task objectives with human
values. One of the most common methods to infer human preferences is by
pairwise comparisons of robot task trajectories. Traditional comparison-based
preference labeling systems seldom support labelers to digest and identify
critical differences between complex trajectories recorded in videos. Our
formative study (N = 12) suggests that individuals may overlook non-salient
task features and establish biased preference criteria during their preference
elicitation process because of partial observations. In addition, they may
experience mental fatigue when given many pairs to compare, causing their label
quality to deteriorate. To mitigate these issues, we propose FARPLS, a
Feature-Augmented Robot trajectory Preference Labeling System. FARPLS
highlights potential outliers in a wide variety of task features that matter to
humans and extracts the corresponding video keyframes for easy review and
comparison. It also dynamically adjusts the labeling order according to users'
familiarities, difficulties of the trajectory pair, and level of disagreements.
At the same time, the system monitors labelers' consistency and provides
feedback on labeling progress to keep labelers engaged. A between-subjects
study (N = 42, 105 pairs of robot pick-and-place trajectories per person) shows
that FARPLS can help users establish preference criteria more easily and notice

  Visualization","Higher-order patterns reveal sequential multistep state transitions, which
are usually superior to origin-destination analysis, which depicts only
first-order geospatial movement patterns. Conventional methods for higher-order
movement modeling first construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of movements,
then extract higher-order patterns from the DAG. However, DAG-based methods
heavily rely on the identification of movement keypoints that are challenging
for sparse movements and fail to consider the temporal variants that are
critical for movements in urban environments. To overcome the limitations, we
propose HoLens, a novel approach for modeling and visualizing higher-order
movement patterns in the context of an urban environment. HoLens mainly makes
twofold contributions: first, we design an auto-adaptive movement aggregation
algorithm that self-organizes movements hierarchically by considering spatial
proximity, contextual information, and temporal variability; second, we develop
an interactive visual analytics interface consisting of well-established
visualization techniques, including the H-Flow for visualizing the higher-order
patterns on the map and the higher-order state sequence chart for representing
the higher-order state transitions. Two real-world case studies manifest that
the method can adaptively aggregate the data and exhibit the process of how to
explore the higher-order patterns by HoLens. We also demonstrate our approach's
feasibility, usability, and effectiveness through an expert interview with
three domain experts.","sequential multistep state transitions,origin-destination analysis,auto-adaptive movement aggregation

structure: technical building blocks, user-facing explanatory artefacts and
social communication protocols. While we concur that user studies are
invaluable in assessing the quality and effectiveness of explanation
presentation and delivery strategies from the explainees' perspective in a
particular deployment context, the underlying explanation generation mechanisms
require a separate, predominantly algorithmic validation strategy that accounts
for the technical and human-centred desiderata of their (numerical) outputs.

allow to systematically reason about the properties and downstream influence of

gains an accuracy of 58\% and a mean absolute error of 7.00. In contrast, the
Llama2 model indicates an accuracy of 56\% with a mean absolute error of 7.63.

in writing tools by enabling users to generate text through prompts. This
paradigm shifts some creative control from the user to the system, thereby
diminishing the user's authorship and autonomy in the writing process. To
restore autonomy, we introduce Textfocals, a UI prototype designed to
investigate a human-centered approach that emphasizes the user's role in
writing. Textfocals supports the writing process by providing LLM-generated
summaries, questions, and advice (i.e., LLM views) in a sidebar of a text
editor, encouraging reflection and self-driven revision in writing without
direct text generation. Textfocals' UI affordances, including contextually
adaptive views and scaffolding for prompt selection and customization, offer a
novel way to interact with LLMs where users maintain full authorship of their
writing. A formative user study with Textfocals showed promising evidence that
this approach might help users develop underdeveloped ideas, cater to the
rhetorical audience, and clarify their writing. However, the study also showed
interaction design challenges related to document navigation and scoping,
prompt engineering, and context management. Our work highlights the breadth of

Metamorpheus arranges the storyline based on a dream's emotional arc, and

depictions. The system provides metaphor suggestions, and generates visual
metaphors and text depictions using generative AI models, while users can apply
generations to recolour and re-arrange the interface to be visually affective.
